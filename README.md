## 📜 The Story
Step into the shoes of an adventurer. Whether you are exploring medieval castles, drifting through deep space, or tinkering with modern gadgets, your goal remains the same: **Recall the ancient symbols before your attempts run out.**

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Themes:** Choose between *Medieval, Space, Animals,* and *Gadgets*. Each theme changes the visual symbols and background music.
* **Atmospheric Audio:** Integrated YouTube IFrame API to provide background music tailored to your chosen theme.
* **Wisdom Rewards:** Successfully matching a pair fetches a "useless but fun" fact from a public API to keep the player engaged.
* **Pressure System:** A countdown timer and a 25-attempt limit make the game challenging.
* **Fully Responsive:** Playable on everything from ancient scrolls (phones) to modern workstations (desktops).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Custom grid layouts and `preserve-3d` flip animations.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Game logic, state management, and timer systems.
* **YouTube IFrame API:** For background audio management.
* **Fetch API:** Integrated with `uselessfacts.jsph.pl` for real-time data retrieval.
* **Google Fonts:** Using `MedievalSharp` for that authentic historical feel.

## 🎮 How to Play
1.  Enter your **Adventurer's Name**.
2.  Select your **Theme** (this will change the music!).
3.  Click cards to flip them. Match all pairs in under **25 attempts**.
4.  If you fail, the "Game Over" modal will let you try again.

## 🔧 Installation & Local Setup
